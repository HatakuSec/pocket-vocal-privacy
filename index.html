  <h1>Privacy Policy for Pocket Vocal (iOS)</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: 11 December 2025</em></p>

  <p>Pocket Vocal respects your privacy. This policy explains what we (the app publisher) collect, how we use it, and your choices.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>App usage and diagnostics</strong>: Basic event logging and crash diagnostics to keep the app stable. No voice recordings or microphone audio are stored.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase status</strong>: Anonymous purchase receipts/entitlements to unlock premium access.</li>
    <li><strong>Streak and practice stats</strong>: Dates of completed sessions to show streaks and history. These are stored locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Support communications</strong>: If you contact us, we may retain the message to resolve your request.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide core app features (warmups, drills, streak tracking).</li>
    <li>Process and validate purchases, and restore access on your devices.</li>
    <li>Improve reliability and troubleshoot crashes or bugs.</li>
    <li>Communicate important updates or respond to support inquiries.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Practice streak data is stored locally on your device. Deleting the app removes this data.</li>
    <li>Purchase receipts may be kept by Apple and validated as needed to restore access.</li>
    <li>Diagnostic logs are retained only as long as needed to investigate issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your data.</li>
    <li>We may share minimal data with service providers (e.g., Apple for in-app purchases, crash reporting services) solely to operate the app.</li>
    <li>We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights and users.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Choices and Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can clear practice data by deleting the app from your device.</li>
    <li>You can disable analytics or crash reporting in iOS Settings if provided by the OS or the app (future setting may be added).</li>
    <li>Microphone access is required for pitch detection; you can revoke it in iOS Settings at any time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The app is not directed to children under 9. If you are a parent/guardian and believe your child provided data, contact us to request deletion.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard measures to protect data in transit and at rest. No method is 100% secure; use the app at your discretion.</p>

  <h2>International Use</h2>
  <p>Data may be processed on servers outside your country. By using the app, you consent to this processing.</p>

  <h2>Analytics & Crash Reporting</h2>
  <p>Pocket Vocal does not collect analytics or crash reports outside of Apple's built-in diagnostics.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this policy, contact: <a href="mailto:pocketvocal@outlook.com">pocketvocal@outlook.com</a></p>
