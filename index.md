# Privacy Policy for Singing Teacher (iOS)

_Last updated: 11 December 2025_

Please read this policy to understand what information the Pocket Vocal app does and does not collect.

Singing Teacher respects your privacy. This policy explains what we (the app publisher) collect, how we use it, and your choices.

## Information We Collect
Pocket Vocal does not collect analytics or crash reports outside of Apple’s built-in diagnostics.
- **App usage and diagnostics:** Basic event logging and crash diagnostics to keep the app stable. No voice recordings or microphone audio are stored.

- **Purchase status:** Anonymous purchase receipts/entitlements to unlock premium access.
- **Streak and practice stats:** Dates of completed sessions to show streaks and history. These are stored locally on your device.
- **Support communications:** If you contact us, we may retain the message to resolve your request.

## How We Use Information
- Provide core app features (warmups, drills, streak tracking).
- Process and validate purchases, and restore access on your devices.
- Improve reliability and troubleshoot crashes or bugs.
- Communicate important updates or respond to support inquiries.

## Data Storage and Retention
- Practice streak data is stored locally on your device. Deleting the app removes this data.
- Purchase receipts may be kept by Apple and validated as needed to restore access.
- Diagnostic logs are retained only as long as needed to investigate issues.

## Sharing
- We do **not** sell your data.
- We may share minimal data with service providers (e.g., Apple for in‑app purchases, crash reporting services) solely to operate the app.
- We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights and users.

## Your Choices and Controls
- You can clear practice data by deleting the app from your device.
- You can disable analytics or crash reporting in iOS Settings if provided by the OS or the app (future setting may be added).
- Microphone access is required for pitch detection; you can revoke it in iOS Settings at any time.

## Children
The app is not directed to children under 9. If you are a parent/guardian and believe your child provided data, contact us to request deletion.

## Security
We use industry-standard measures to protect data in transit and at rest. No method is 100% secure; use the app at your discretion.

## International Use
Data may be processed on servers outside your country. By using the app, you consent to this processing.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy. Material changes will be highlighted in the app or release notes. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated policy.
